## Abstract

The perception link is the first crucial step in the autonomous driving process. Earlier 3D point cloud perception algorithms and datasets often focused on enhancing the performance indicators of the algorithms while neglecting the detection of small targets, such as vulnerable groups in traffic. To address this issue, creating high-quality datasets for these disadvantaged groups is essential. This article introduces a new joint simulation strategy that combines Carla and Apollo to enhance data quality and improve model performance. The strategy was tested on the PointPillar algorithm and the Voxel R-CNN algorithm, yielding the desired results.
