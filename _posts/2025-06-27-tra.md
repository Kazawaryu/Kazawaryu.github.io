This is an example post with videos. It supports local video files.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

It does also support embedding videos from different sources. Here are some examples:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yw411C7Dx/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=0ef116e5aa321a2ea2b390702d94c759" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqL-V8-h3mQ" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
