Iâ€™m an undergraduate at the Southern University of Science and Technology, passionately exploring 3D perception algorithms, optimal control, and optimizing datasets to advance the exciting field of autonomous driving.

I have interned as a Research Assistant for one and a half years, at the Intelligent Sensing and Unmanned System Lab within the Computer Science and Engineering department. My internship is under the joint supervision of Professor Qi Hao and Research Professor Gongjin Lan.

I have been admitted to the University of Georgia for a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, starting in Fall 2025. I am excited to continue my research journey there.
