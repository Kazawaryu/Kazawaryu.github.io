I am the first year Ph.D. student majoring in mechanical engineering at the University of Georgia. During my undergraduate studies at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), I passionately explored 3D perception algorithms, optimal control, and optimizing datasets to advance the exciting field of autonomous driving.

I have interned as a Research Assistant for one and a half years, at the Intelligent Sensing and Unmanned System Lab within the Computer Science and Engineering department.
