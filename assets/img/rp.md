# Research Proposal
<!-- theme: reliable sensing system for robots under reality constraints -->

## Summary of the Proposal

## Background
<!-- 
In the background section, write briefly using as many paragraphs, lists, tables, figures as you can about the main problem you select to study for your research. Remember that this will need to be a quantitative research study. In the background section, you will generally organise your writing along the following:

\item Start by writing what do we know about the topic
\item Then write about what do we NOT know about the topic 
\item Then write about what about the unknowns that you are going to address -->

Although the sensing algorithms based on LiDAR, camera have been developed and improved significantly, the reliability of the sensing system for robots is still a challenging problem, especially for the small and wearable robots.
In reality, the sensing system is subject to mutiple constraints, involving limited computational resources, week GNSS signals, unstable communications. These constraints make it difficult to design a reliable sensing system that can operate effectively in a wide range of environments and conditions.
<!-- 
Start by writing what do we know about the topic  -->
LiDAR is the most outstanding sensor for most robots. It provides accurate and wide-range measurances, and is deployed in many applications already.

<!-- Then write about what do we NOT know about the topic -->
However, for small and wearable robots, as the high-enegy cosumption, large size, high weight, and heat dissipation, it is not suitable.

<!-- Then write about what about the unknowns that you are going to address -->
Due to these contriants, a new type LiDAR sensor, UniTree L1 can be considered.
The sensor is small, light, and low-energy consumption, which is suitable for small and wearable robots and most tasks.

## Expected research contribution

<!-- My future research aims to achieve a more efficient and reliable perception system for small or wearable robots.
The first Objective is to develop a registration algorithm for large and frequent swaying conditions.
Moreover, an asynchronous perception algorithm must also be developed under the joint network and GNSS constraints in complex scenarios.
Furthermore, the research results will be published in at least two papers, one on the registration algorithm and the other on the asynchronous perception algorithm. -->

<!-- Why is your research question or hypothesis worth asking? -->

As the perception module is the foundation of the robot, the reliability of the perception system is crucial for the robot's performance. The research aims to develop a reliable perception system for robots under reality constraints, which is a significant contribution to the field of robotics.

<!-- How is the current research lacking or falling short? -->

Current registration algorithms are not suitable for large and frequent swaying conditions, especially for data collected by small sensors.

<!-- What impact will your research have on the discipline? -->

With massive real-world constraints, the efficiency and reliability of the system are essential and challenging. 

<!-- Will you be extending an area of knowledge, applying it to new contexts, solving a problem, testing a theory, or challenging an existing one? -->

My research will apply the LiDAR to small or wearable robots, which support more applications and scenarios.

<!-- Establish why your research is important by convincing your audience there is a gap. -->

Moreover it will fill the gap in the perception system for small or wearable robots, which is essential for the development of robots.

<!-- What will be the outcome of your research contribution? -->

The result will be published in at least two papers, one on the registration algorithm and the other on the asynchronous perception algorithm.

<!-- Demonstrate both your current level of knowledge and how the pursuit of your question or hypothesis will create a new understanding and generate new 
information. -->
